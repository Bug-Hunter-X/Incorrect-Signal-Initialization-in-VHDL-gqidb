# Incorrect Signal Initialization in VHDL
This repository demonstrates a common error in VHDL code: incorrect initialization of a signal.  The `internal_reg` signal in `bug.vhdl` is initialized to `x"00"`, which is not a valid initialization for a std_logic_vector in all contexts.  This can lead to unpredictable simulation results.  The corrected code in `bugSolution.vhdl` shows the proper way to initialize the signal.

## How to Reproduce the Bug
1. Simulate `bug.vhdl` using your preferred VHDL simulator.
2. Observe unexpected behavior due to the incorrect initialization of `internal_reg`.

## Solution
The solution involves initializing `internal_reg` to a valid value (e.g., "00000000" or a specific default value that matches the design intent), or making use of 'U' in the signal declaration to reflect the uninitialized state.

## Key Learning
Always correctly initialize signals in VHDL to avoid unexpected behavior and ensure predictable and reliable simulations and synthesis results. Be aware of the difference between initialization using a value and the uninitialized 'U' state.
